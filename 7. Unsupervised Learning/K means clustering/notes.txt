Part 1

K means algo: metric- euclidean
link: http://www.utdallas.edu/~axn112530/cs6375/unsupervised/test_data.txt

input: k, input file, output file path

initialize k points as means

termination: centroids no longer move or iterations 25 whichever is earlier.

Validation: sum of squares error

SSE:

for all k centroids:
	for all x in cluster with kth centroid:
		sum over dist(centroid-i, x)^2

A method to compute this.

Output:

cluster-id, list of points in this cluster

1	2, 4, 7, 10
...
SSE_value

Run atleast 5 times with different k
